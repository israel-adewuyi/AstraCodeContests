        "generation": "Okay, I need to write a Python program to solve this competitive programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully and think about how to approach it.\n\nThe problem says that Takahashi set goals for N days. Each day i, he aimed to complete A_i tasks, but he actually completed B_i. I need to find how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm, so for each day from 1 to N, I should compare B_i with A_i. If B_i is greater than A_i, then it's a day where he exceeded his goal. I need to count how many such days there are.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The input starts with an integer N. Then there are N lines, each with A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, I can read N, then read N lines, each containing two integers.\n\nOnce I have all the B_i values, I can compare each B_i with A_i.\n\nWait, let's think: for each day i, if B_i > A_i, then it's a day we count. So I'll initialize a counter to 0. Then, for each of the N days, check if B_i > A_i, and if yes, increment the counter.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read N.\n2. Read N pairs of A_i and B_i.\n3. Initialize a counter to 0.\n4. Loop through each pair:\n   a. If B_i > A_i, increment counter.\n5. After checking all days, output the counter.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code.\n\nFirst, I can read N with input(). Then, for the next N lines, I'll read each line and split into A and B.\n\nSo something like:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, is that all? Hmm, yes, I think so.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nLooking at the first sample:\n\nTest Case 1:\nInput is 4, followed by four lines:\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, days 1-4.\n\nCheck each B_i:\n8>2 \u2192 yes, count 1\n5=5 \u2192 no\n4<5 \u2192 no\n7>6 \u2192 yes, count 2. So total 2, which matches the output.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nWait, but what about the input format? The input is read as:\n\nn\nA1 B1\nA2 B2\n...\nAN BN\n\nSo, the first line is N, and then N lines follow, each has two integers.\n\nIn code:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nTesting the second test case in the examples:\n\nInput is 5, then 5 lines of 1 1. So for each, 1 is not greater than 1. So count remains 0. So output is 0.\n\nThird test case, but I'm not going to check the details, but the code should handle it.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward. I think that's all I need to write.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. We will compare the number of tasks he completed each day with his goal and count how many days he met or exceeded his goal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of days and the task completion data for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the number of tasks completed with the goal. If the completed tasks exceed the goal, increment a counter.\n3. **Output Result**: Print the count of days where the tasks completed exceeded the goal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is the number of days, `n`. The subsequent lines contain pairs of integers representing the goal and actual tasks completed each day.\n2. **Comparison Loop**: For each day, we check if the number of tasks completed (B_i) is greater than the goal (A_i). If true, we increment our count.\n3. **Output**: Finally, we print the total count of days where the tasks completed exceeded the goal.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the required days by iterating through each day and comparing the given values, ensuring we get the correct result in linear time, which is optimal given the constraints.",

The input format is:\n\nN\nA1 B1\nA2 B2\n...\nAN BN\n\nSo, in Python, I can read the first line as an integer N. Then, for the next N lines, read each as a pair of integers.\n\nI think I can store the data in a list of tuples. Like, each tuple is (A_i, B_i), for i from 1 to N.\n\nOnce I have this list, I can iterate through each pair and check if B_i > A_i.\n\nI'll initialize a counter to zero. Then, for each day, check if B_i is greater than A_i, and if so, increment the counter.\n\nFinally, output the counter.\n\nLet me think about how to read the data. Let's say after reading N, I'll loop N times, each time reading a line, split into two parts, convert to integers.\n\nLike, for _ in range(N):\n    A, B = map(int, input().split())\n    add (A, B) to the list.\n\nThen, for each A, B in this list, count how many times B > A.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\n1. Read N.\n2. Read N lines, collect (A, B) pairs.\n3. Initialize count to 0.\n4. For each pair, check if B > A, if yes, add 1 to count.\n5. Print the count.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nTake test case 1:\nInput is 4, then four lines:\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, for each day:\nDay 1: 8 > 2 \u2192 yes. Count 1.\nDay 2: 5 not >5 \u2192 no.\nDay 3:4 <5 \u2192 no.\nDay4:7>6 \u2192 yes. So total 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nFirst, read N:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen, create a list to hold the pairs. Maybe something like:\n\ndays = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    days.append( (a, b) )\n\nThen, count = 0\n\nfor a, b in days:\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nWait, let me see the sample test case 2:\n\nInput is 5 lines of 1 1. So each B is not more than A, so count 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should look like:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nHmm, that's simple enough.\n\nLet me write it.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe full code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nI think that's it.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1's code would read 4, then 4 lines, and the count would be 2.\n\nSo, I think this should work.\n\nSo, the code is as above.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. We will process the input data to check each day's task completion and count the days where the actual completed tasks exceed the set goal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: First, we read the number of days \\( N \\). Then, we read the task goals and actual completed tasks for each day.\n2. **Checking Conditions**: For each day, we compare the actual completed tasks with the set goal. If the actual completed tasks are more, we increment our count.\n3. **Output Result**: Finally, we print the count of days where the task completion exceeds the goal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input gives the number of days \\( N \\).

If true, we increment our count.\n3. **Output**: The count of days where tasks were completed more than the goal is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each day's data in a single loop, ensuring a clear and concise solution to the problem.",

Maybe I can store them as a list of tuples or something.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to read all the lines after N, split them into A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, maybe:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n\nDoes that make sense? Let me see.\n\nWait, in the first sample input, for example, the first test case has 4 days.\n\nLooking at the input lines:\n\n2 8 --> 8>2, yes, so count increases.\n5 5 --> no.\n5 4 --> yes.\n6 7 --> yes. So 3 days? Wait, no, sample output is 2.\n\nWait, maybe I should recount.\n\nWait, the sample input 1's output is 2. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the input:\n\n4\n\n2 8 \u2192 8>2 \u2192 yes.\n\n5 5 \u2192 5 not >5.\n\n5 4 \u21924<5.\n\n6 7 \u21927>6.\n\nSo that's two days. So the code would output 2, which is correct.\n\nHmm, so the code seems right.\n\nSo, putting it together.\n\nLet's write the code.\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen, initialize count to 0.\n\ncount = 0\n\nThen, loop n times:\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\n\nFinally, print(count).\n\nWait, yes, that's the plan.\n\nTesting with the sample input 1, it should output 2.\n\nWhat about the second test case? Let me see.\n\nThe input is 5 days, each with 1 1. So, none of the B_i's are greater than A_i. So count is 0.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait. The sample input has more lines. Let me check the first sample input.\n\nThe input is:\n\n4\n\n2 8\n\n5 5\n\n5 4\n\n6 7\n\nSo, the code reads 4 lines after the first. So the loop runs 4 times, each reading a line.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the solution. Let me write the code.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: First, we read the number of days, \\( N \\), and then read the task goals and actual completed tasks for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the actual completed tasks with the goal. If the actual completed tasks are more than the goal, increment a counter.\n3. **Output Result**: Finally, print the count of days where the actual completed tasks exceed the goal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is the number of days \\( N \\). Each subsequent line contains two integers representing the goal and actual completed tasks for each day.\n2. **Comparison Loop**: For each day, we check if the actual completed tasks are greater than the goal. If true, we increment our count.\n3. **Output**: The count of days where the goal was exceeded is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the days by iterating through each day's task details and comparing the values, ensuring an optimal and straightforward solution.",

Let me read the problem statement carefully and figure out how to approach it.\n\nSo the problem says that Takahashi has set N task goals for N days. Each day i, he aimed to complete A_i tasks, but actually completed B_i. I need to find out how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm, so for each day from 1 to N, I have to compare B_i and A_i. If B_i is greater than A_i, then that day counts towards the answer.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The input starts with N, the number of days. Then there are N lines, each containing A_i and B_i.\n\nSo I'll probably read the first line as N. Then read N lines, each split into two integers.\n\nOnce I have the data, I can loop through each pair (A_i, B_i), check if B_i > A_i. For each day where this is true, increment a counter.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. Maybe I can store the A and B values as lists of tuples. Or just process each pair as I read them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to read all the lines, then process them.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n2. Read N lines, each containing A_i and B_i. So, maybe a list of tuples, where each tuple is (A, B).\n3. Initialize a counter to 0.\n4. Loop through each (A, B) pair:\n   - if B > A, then increment counter.\n5. After checking all days, print the counter.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, how to read the input.\n\nThe input format is:\n\nFirst line is N.\n\nThen N lines, each with two integers: A_i and B_i.\n\nIn Python, I can read the first line as N = int(input().strip()).\n\nThen, for the next N lines, I can loop and read each as A, B. Maybe I can read each line, split into parts, convert to integers, and store them.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nn = int(input())\ndays = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    days.append( (a, b) )\n\nThen, initialize count = 0.\n\nfor a, b in days:\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\n\nThen, print(count)\n\nWait, that's the plan.\n\nLet me think about the test cases.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\nInput is 4, then 4 lines of A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, for each day, check if B_i > A_i.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is 2.\n\nLet me see why. Let's see each day:\n\nDay 1: 2 and 8. 8>2 \u2192 count.\nDay2:5 and5 \u2192 no.\nDay3:5 and4 \u2192 no.\nDay4:6 and7 \u2192 yes.

So 5 lines where B is not greater than A. So count is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThird test case is 6, but I think it's handled the same.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo, I think the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal.

Each day i, he aimed to complete A_i tasks, but he actually completed B_i. I need to find out how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm, so for each day, I have to compare B_i (actual) and A_i (goal). If B_i > A_i, then that day counts towards the answer.\n\nSo the plan is: read the input, iterate through each day, count the number of days where B_i > A_i.\n\nLet me think about the input format. The first line is N, the number of days. Then there are N lines, each containing A_i and B_i.\n\nSo for example, in the first test case, N is 4. Then four lines follow, each with A and B.\n\nSo in code, I can do the following:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n2. Then read N lines, each split into A_i and B_i.\n3. For each of these, check if B_i > A_i.\n4. Keep a counter that increments each time this condition is true.\n5. Finally, output the counter.\n\nHow to structure this in code.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nFirst, read N. Then, for N times, read a line, split into two parts, convert to integers, A and B.\n\nWait, but in the input, each of the N lines is A_i and B_i. So for each of the N lines, I'll get A and B, and check if B > A.\n\nSo let's think about the code.\n\nI can initialize a counter to 0.\n\nThen, for each of the N lines:\n\n   read A, B\n\n   if B > A:\n\n       counter +=1\n\nAt the end, print counter.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, get N.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen, initialize count to 0.\n\ncount = 0\n\nThen, loop n times:\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if b > a:\n\n        count +=1\n\nAfter all loops, print(count).\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nLooking at the first test case:\n\nInput:\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, for each day:\n\nDay 1: 8>2 \u2192 yes \u2192 count 1.\n\nDay 2: 5=5 \u2192 no.\n\nDay 3:4<5 \u2192 no.\n\nDay4:7>6 \u2192 yes \u2192 count 2.\n\nSo output 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nHmm, that's it? I think so.\n\nLet me see the sample inputs.\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n5\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\nSo for each day, B is 1, A is 1. So 1 is not greater than 1. So count is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird test case:\n\n6\n1 6\n2 5\n3 4\n4 3\n5 2\n6 1\n\nSo each B is greater than A:\n\n6>1 \u2192 yes.\n\n5>2 \u2192 yes.\n\n4>3 \u2192 yes.\n\n3>4? No.\n\n2>5? No.\n\n1>6? No.\n\nSo count is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nSo writing the code as I thought.\n\nI'll write it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of days and the task completion details for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the number of tasks completed (B_i) with the goal (A_i). If the completed tasks are more than the goal, increment the count.\n3. **Output Result**: Print the total count of days where the task completion exceeds the goal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first input value is the number of days, `n`. Each subsequent line contains two integers, `A_i` and `B_i`, representing the goal and actual task completion for that day.\n2. **Counting Days**: For each day, check if the completed tasks (`B_i`) are greater than the goal (`A_i`). If true, increment the count.\n3. **Output**: Finally, print the count of days where tasks were completed more than the goal.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each day and counts the days where the completion goal was met, providing the required result.",

The first line is N, the number of days.\n2. Then, read N lines each containing A_i and B_i.\n3. For each of these N pairs, check if B_i > A_i.\n4. Count how many times this condition is true.\n5. Output the count.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, read N. Then, read N lines. Each line has two integers. I can store them in a list of tuples or something similar.\n\nMaybe I can read each pair as a list, like (A_i, B_i), and loop through each.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nThat's straightforward.

Let's see:\n\nA_i and B_i are given, but I think the code will correctly count how many days B_i > A_i.\n\nSo, I think the code is simple.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen, initialize count to 0.\n\ncount = 0\n\nThen, for _ in range(n), read each A_i and B_i.\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\n\nThen, print count.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nLet me test this with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst test case:\n\nAfter processing four lines:\n\nFirst line is 2 8 \u2192 8>2 \u2192 count 1.\n\nSecond line 5 5 \u2192 no.\n\nThird 5 4 \u2192 no.\n\nFourth 6 7 \u2192 7>6 \u2192 count 2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 5 days, all A_i and B_i are 1. So, no days where B_i> A_i. So count is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nI think that's the solution. Let's write it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his set goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: First, we read the number of days, \\( N \\), and then read the task completion data for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the actual tasks completed (\\( B_i \\)) with the goal (\\( A_i \\)). If \\( B_i \\) is greater than \\( A_i \\), count that day.\n3. **Count Days**: Maintain a counter to keep track of how many days meet the condition \\( B_i > A_i \\).\n4. **Output Result**: Finally, print the count of days where the task completion exceeded the goal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input gives the number of days, \\( N \\). Each subsequent line provides the goal (\\( A_i \\)) and actual task completion (\\( B_i \\)) for each day.\n2. **Comparison Loop**: For each day, we check if the actual tasks completed exceed the goal. If they do, we increment our count.\n3. **Output**: After processing all days, we print the total count of days where the task completion exceeded the goal.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each day individually and counts the days where the task completion exceeded the goal, providing the solution in a straightforward manner.",

Let me read the problem statement carefully and think about how to approach it.\n\nSo the problem says that Takahashi set N task goals for N days. Each day i, he aimed to complete A_i tasks and actually did B_i. I need to find out how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm. So, for each day from 1 to N, I have to compare B_i and A_i. If B_i is greater than A_i, then that day counts towards the answer.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input format is given. The first line is N, which is the number of days. Then there are N lines, each containing A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, I need to read N, then read N pairs of A_i and B_i.\n\nOnce I have all the B_i and A_i, I can loop through each day and check if B_i > A_i.\n\nI'll initialize a counter to 0. Then, for each i in 0 to N-1 (or 1 to N, depending on how the data is read), check if B_i > A_i, and if so, increment the counter.\n\nWait, but in the input, the first line after N is A_1 B_1, and so on. So for i from 0 to N-1 (if using 0-based index), I can get A_i and B_i.\n\nSo let's plan the steps:\n\n1. Read N.\n2. Read N lines, each with A_i and B_i. So I can store them in a list of tuples, perhaps.\n3. Iterate through each tuple, and for each, check if B > A.\n4. Count how many such cases.\n5. Output the count.\n\nLet me think about how to read the input. For example, the first test case in the sample input is:\n\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, for N=4, we have 4 lines after N. So, perhaps I can read N, then read N lines, split each into A and B, and collect them as a list.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\ndays = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    days.append( (a, b) )\n\nThen, initialize count = 0.\n\nfor a, b in days:\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\n\nThen, print count.\n\nWait, that's the plan.\n\nTesting with the first sample:\n\nTest case 1: days are:\n\n(2,8) \u2192 8>2 \u2192 yes.\n\n(5,5) \u2192 5 is not >5 \u2192 no.\n\n(5,4) \u2192 no.\n\n(6,7) \u2192 yes.\n\nSo count is 2, which is the sample output.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nLet me write it.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nHmm, that's it? It seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test it against the sample input.\n\nFor the first test case, the code would loop 4 times.\n\n- 2,8 \u2192 8>2 \u2192 count 1.\n\n- 5,5 \u2192 no.\n\n- 5,4 \u2192 no.\n\n- 6,7 \u2192 yes, count becomes 2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: the second test case is N=5, all B_i equals A_i. So count is 0.\n\nThird test case: let's see, the output is 3. I'll trust the code.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nI think that's it.

Let's read the problem statement carefully and think about how to approach it.\n\nSo, the task is: Takahashi set some goal for N days, and on each day i, he aims to complete A_i tasks. But he actually completed B_i. We need to find out how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm, so for each day from 1 to N, I should check if B_i is greater than A_i. Then count how many such days there are.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input format says: first comes N, then N lines each with A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, let's see, for example, in the first sample input, N is 4, followed by four lines. Each line has two integers.\n\nI think I should read N first, then read N lines, each containing two integers.\n\nOnce I have all the A and B values, I can loop through each pair and check if B_i > A_i.

For each i in 0 to N-1, check if B_i > A_i. If yes, increment the counter.\n6. After checking all days, output the counter.\n\nWait, let me think about how the input is given. The sample input in the first test case is:\n\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, for each of these 4 lines, A_i and B_i are given.\n\nSo, I can read N, then read N lines, each split into two integers, storing them as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each tuple, check if B > A, count the number of such cases.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's pretty straightforward. Let me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn is 4.\n\nDays 1-4.\n\nDay 1: 2 8 \u2192 8>2 \u2192 count 1\nDay 2:5 5 \u2192 not\nDay3:5 4 \u2192 no\nDay4:6 7 \u2192 yes\nTotal 2. So output 2, which matches the sample.\n\nYes, the code should work.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nWait, let's write it.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nLet me see the second sample.\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\nSo, for each day, B is 1, A is 1. So no days where B>A. So count is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:\n\n6\n\n1 6 \u2192 6>1 \u2192 yes\n2 5 \u2192 5>2 \u2192 yes\n3 4 \u2192 4>3 \u2192 yes\n4 3 \u2192 no\n5 2 \u2192 yes\n6 1 \u2192 yes\n\nSo, 5 days. But the sample output is 3. Wait, what? Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait the third test case's output is 3.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm miscounting. Wait, the input for the third case is:\n\n6\n\n1 6 \u2192 yes\n\n2 5 \u2192 yes\n\n3 4 \u2192 yes\n\n4 3 \u2192 no\n\n5 2 \u2192 yes\n\n6 1 \u2192 yes\n\nSo that's 5, but sample output is 3. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, perhaps the sample expects the count of days where B_i > A_i. So, in the third test case, 5, but the sample output is 3. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the sample input.\n\nThird test case input:\n\n6\n\n1 6\n\n2 5\n\n3 4\n\n4 3\n\n5 2\n\n6 1\n\nSo, each B_i is greater than A_i?\n\nYes:\n\n6>1 \u2192 yes.\n\n5>2 \u2192 yes.\n\n4>3 \u2192 yes.\n\n3<4 \u2192 no.\n\n2>5? No, 2 <5.\n\n1>6? No.\n\nSo, the days where B>A are the first four. So 4 days. But sample output is 3.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So perhaps my code isn't correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nAh, wait the problem says 'number of days when he completed more tasks than his goal.' So it's B_i > A_i. So, for each day, if B_i > A_i, count it.\n\nSo, let's count how many B_i are larger than A_i.\n\nIn the third sample:\n\n- 6>1 \u2192 yes (count 1)\n-5>2 \u2192 yes (2)\n-4>3 \u2192 yes (3)\n-3<4 \u2192 no\n-2<5 \u2192 no\n-1<6 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, total 3 days. So sample output is 3.\n\nSo why is my code output 4? Because I thought the first four, but let's recount.\n\nIn the third test case, the four lines:\n\n1 6 \u2192 yes\n\n2 5 \u2192 yes\n\n3 4 \u2192 yes\n\n4 3 \u2192 no\n\n5 2 \u2192 yes\n\n6 1 \u2192 yes\n\nSo, the count is 4 days, but sample output is 3.\n\nHmm, I'm confused. What's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the sample input.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nIn the third case, it's:\n\n6\n\n1 6\n\n2 5\n\n3 4\n\n4 3\n\n5 2\n\n6 1\n\nSo, 6 lines.\n\nDays 1-6.\n\nCheck B_i:\n\n6>1 \u2192 yes.\n\n5>2 \u2192 yes.\n\n4>3 \u2192 yes.\n\n3>4 \u2192 no.\n\n2>5 \u2192 no.\n\n1>6 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, days 1,2,3 are yes. So count is 3.\n\nSo why did I get 4 earlier? Because I thought the first four, but 4 days. So, I must have miscounted.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nSo, the code I wrote earlier is correct, and for the third test case, it will output 3.\n\nSo, in the code, it should be.\n\nSo, I think the code is correct.\n\nSo, I think the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nLet me test it.\n\nSo, in the first sample, it returns 2.\n\nSo, I think this should work.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: We start by reading the number of days, \\( N \\), and then read the number of tasks completed each day along with the corresponding goal tasks.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the number of tasks completed with the goal.

Then, initialize a counter to 0.\n\nThen, loop from 0 to N-1 (since we have N pairs), for each, read A and B.\n\nCompare B > A, if yes, add 1 to the counter.\n\nFinally, print the counter.\n\nWait, let me test with the sample input.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is 2.\n\nLooking at the input:\n\n4\n2 8 \u2192 8>2 \u2192 yes\n5 5 \u2192 5=5 \u2192 no\n5 4 \u2192 4<5 \u2192 no\n6 7 \u2192 yes\nSo, two days, so output is 2.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nRead N: n = int(input())\n\nInitialize count = 0\n\nThen, for _ in range(n):\n\n    read a, b from input().split()\n\n    a = int(a)\n\n    b = int(b)\n\n    if b > a:\n\n        count +=1\n\nFinally, print(count)\n\nWait, but the input is given as N, followed by N lines of A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nLet me see the test cases.\n\nIn the second test case, input is 5, then five lines of 1 1. So for each, B is not more than A, so count remains 0.\n\nThird test case has 6 lines, each with B > A, so 3.\n\nSo, I think this code will work.\n\nI think that's all. So putting it all together.\n\nWait, let me write the code.\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: First, we read the number of days, \\( N \\), and then read the number of tasks he aimed to complete and the actual number of tasks he completed each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the number of tasks he actually completed with his goal.

Let's read the problem statement carefully and think about how to approach it.\n\nSo, the problem says that Takahashi set goals for N days. Each day i, he aimed to complete A_i tasks, but he actually completed B_i. I need to find how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm, right. So, for each day from 1 to N, I have to compare B_i and A_i. If B_i is greater than A_i, then that day counts towards the answer.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The input format is given. Let's see the sample input structure.\n\nThe input starts with N, followed by N lines each containing A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, in Python, I can read N first. Then, for each of the next N lines, I can read the A and B values.\n\nSo, I'll probably read the first line as an integer N.\n\nThen, for each of the N lines, I can loop, perhaps, with a loop from 0 to N-1, and for each iteration, read A_i and B_i.\n\nOnce I have all the A and B values, I can loop through each day, compare B_i and A_i, and count how many times B_i > A_i.\n\nWait, yeah. So, I'll initialize a counter to 0. Then, for each day i in 1..N, if B_i > A_i, increment the counter.\n\nOnce I've gone through all days, output the counter.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\n1. Read N.\n2. Read N lines, each containing A and B. Store these as lists. Maybe a list of tuples or just two separate lists.\n3. Initialize a counter to 0.\n4. Loop from 0 to N-1 (assuming zero-based indexing for the lines):\n   a. For each i, get A_i and B_i.\n   b. If B_i > A_i, add 1 to counter.\n5. Print the counter.\n\nWait, but in the input, it's N, then N lines. So, perhaps:\n\nn = int(input())\nthen, for _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    add to a list.\n\nSo, for example, maybe create a list of tuples, or a list where each element is a tuple (A_i, B_i).\n\nLet me think of the data structure. Maybe I can read each pair and store them in a list, like tasks = [ (A1, B1), (A2, B2), ... ].\n\nThen, loop over each pair in tasks, compare B > A, count.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\nInput:\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, days 1-4. For day 1, 8>2 \u2192 yes. Day2, 5=5 \u2192 no. Day3,4<5 \u2192 no. Day4,7>6 \u2192 yes. So 2 days. Which matches the output.\n\nSo, the code would correctly count 2.\n\nSo, this approach seems solid.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWait, the input for each of the next N lines is A_i and B_i. So, in the loop, for each line, split into two integers.\n\nLet's write the code.\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nI think that should do it.\n\nTesting the second test case:\n\n5\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\nEach B is 1, A is 1. So no days where B>A. So count is 0.\n\nThird test case has 6 days, and the output is 3.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code is:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but let me see the input format again.\n\nThe input is:\n\nN\n\nA1 B1\n\nA2 B2\n\n...\n\nAN BN\n\nSo, in code, for each of the N lines, we read a and b.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nSo, I'll write this code.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: We start by reading the number of days, `N`, and then read the task completion details for each of these days.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the actual tasks completed (`B_i`) with the goal tasks (`A_i`). Count how many days meet the condition where the actual tasks completed exceed the goal.\n3. **Output**: Finally, print the count of days where the actual tasks completed were more than the goal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is the number of days, `N`.

Or, if all are equal, then zero.\n\nI think the code should handle that.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Test Case 1:\n\nInput:\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nLet's see:\n\nDay 1: 8>2 \u2192 yes \u2192 count 1\nDay2: 5=5 \u2192 no\nDay3:4<5 \u2192 no\nDay4:7>6 \u2192 yes \u2192 count 2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:5\n1 1\n... five times. So all B_i == A_i, so count 0.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n6\n1 6\n2 5\n3 4\n4 3\n5 2\n6 1\n\nSo:\n\nB_i > A_i on day 1 (6>1), day3 (4>3), day4 (3>4? No), day5 (2>5? No), day6 (1>6? No). So total 3 days.\n\nWhich is the third sample.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe code steps:\n\n1. Read N.\n2. Initialize count =0\n3. For _ in range(N):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\n4. Print(count)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWait, let's write it.\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nI think that's it.\n\nTesting with the sample.\n\nBut let's see, in the first test case, it should output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: First, we read the number of days, \\( N \\), and then read the tasks completed each day along with the task goals for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the number of tasks completed (\\( B_i \\)) with the task goal (\\( A_i \\)). Count how many days \\( B_i \\) exceeds \\( A_i \\).\n3. **Output Result**: Finally, print the count of days where the tasks completed exceed the task goals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is the number of days \\( N \\). Each subsequent line contains two integers representing the tasks completed and the task goal for that day.\n2. **Counting Days**: We initialize a counter to zero. For each day, we check if the tasks completed exceed the task goal. If they do, we increment the counter.\n3. **Output**: The final count is printed, which gives the number of days where Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each day and counts the required days in a straightforward manner, ensuring clarity and correctness.",

Let's read the problem statement carefully and think about how to approach it.\n\nThe problem says that Takahashi has set some task goals for N days. Each day i, he aims to complete A_i tasks, but he actually completed B_i. I need to find out how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm, so for each day from 1 to N, I have to compare B_i with A_i. If B_i is greater than A_i, that's a day where he exceeded his goal. I need to count how many such days.\n\nLet's think about how to structure the code.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The input starts with N, followed by N lines each containing A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, I can read N, then read N lines. For each of those lines, split into A_i and B_i, maybe as integers.\n\nOnce I have all the B_i values, I can compare each with their respective A_i.\n\nWait, but how do I count the days where B_i > A_i? I can loop through each pair, check the condition, and increment a counter each time it's true.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n2. Read N lines, each as A_i and B_i.\n3. Initialize a counter to 0.\n4. For each i from 0 to N-1 (assuming 0-based index), compare B_i > A_i. If yes, increment counter.\n5. After checking all days, output the counter.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input format is a bit specific. Let me see.\n\nThe input format is given as:\n\nThe first line is N. Then N lines, each has A_i and B_i. So, for each of the N lines, I can read them as a pair.\n\nSo in Python, I can read the first line as N = int(input()). Then, for the next N lines, I can loop and read each as a list of integers.\n\nLike, for each of the next N lines, split into two parts, convert to integers.\n\nOnce I have all B_i, I can loop through each, check if B_i > A_i, and count.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nLet me write some pseudocode.\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait: in the input, for each day, it's A_i and B_i. So the first line after N is A_1, B_1, then next is A_2, B_2, etc. So, I can store A and B as lists.\n\nBut for the count, I don't need to store all, just need to compare each B_i with A_i.\n\nSo, maybe collect all B's and A's, then loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can read all the B_i and A_i into separate lists.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think: perhaps read all the lines, split into a list, and process each.\n\nBut for simplicity, I can read each line, split into A and B, and for each, compare.\n\nSo, let's code it.\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\nInput is:\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, days are 1-4.\n\nFor each day:\nDay 1: 8>2 \u2192 count +=1\nDay2:5=5 \u2192 no\nDay3:4<5 \u2192 no\nDay4:7>6 \u2192 count +=1\nTotal 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would output 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the initial code. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the code, each loop, I read a and b. Then compare b > a, and increment.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but let me check the second sample:\n\nInput is 5, and 5 lines of 1 1.\n\nSo, for each, b is 1, a is 1. 1>1 is false, so count remains 0.\n\nSo output is 0, which matches.\n\nThird sample's output is 3. Let's see.\n\nThe third input is 6, with 6 lines:\n\n1 6\n\n2 5\n\n3 4\n\n4 3\n\n5 2\n\n6 1\n\nSo, compare each:\n\n6>1 \u2192 yes\n\n5>2 \u2192 yes\n\n4>3 \u2192 yes\n\n3>4 \u2192 no\n\n2>5 \u2192 no\n\n1>6 \u2192 no.\n\nSo count is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle it.\n\nSo, the code is as I wrote.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will read N, then loop N times, read A_i and B_i, compare, count.\n\nThen, print the count.\n\nSo, I can write:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: We first read the number of days, \\( N \\), and then read the tasks completed each day along with the tasks aimed for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the number of tasks completed with the task goal.

Let's see.\n\nLines:\n\n1 6 \u2192 6>1 \u2192 yes.\n\n2 5 \u21925>2 \u2192 yes.\n\n3 4 \u2192 yes.\n\n4 3 \u2192 no.\n\n5 2 \u2192 no.\n\n6 1 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, 3 days.

So, putting it all together.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's the solution.\n\nI can write this as the code.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. We will compare the number of tasks he completed each day with his goal and count the days where he met this goal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of days \\( N \\) and the tasks completed and goals for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, check if the number of tasks completed exceeds the goal.\n3. **Count**: Maintain a count of how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n4. **Output**: Print the count of days where the task completion was more than the goal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is the number of days \\( N \\). The subsequent lines contain pairs of integers representing the tasks completed and the goals for each day.\n2. **Comparison Loop**: For each day, we compare the tasks completed (B_i) with the goal (A_i). If \\( B_i \\) is greater than \\( A_i \\), we increment our count.\n3. **Output the Result**: After processing all days, we print the count of days where the task completion was more than the goal.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each day's data and checks the required condition, providing the result in linear time, which is optimal given the constraints.",

Let me read the problem statement carefully and think about how to approach it.\n\nThe problem says that Takahashi set some task goals for N days. Each day i, he aimed to complete A_i tasks, but he actually completed B_i. I need to find out how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm, so for each day, I compare B_i and A_i. If B_i is greater than A_i, that counts towards the answer. I need to count how many such days exist.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll need to read the input. The input starts with an integer N, which is the number of days. Then there are N lines, each containing two integers A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, in Python, I can read N, then read N lines, each line split into two integers.\n\nOnce I have all the A and B values, I can loop through each day from 1 to N, check if B_i > A_i, and count how many times this is true.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read N.\n2. Read N pairs of A and B, perhaps storing them as lists or something.\n3. Initialize a counter to zero.\n4. For each day, compare B_i and A_i. If B_i > A_i, increment the counter.\n5. After checking all days, output the counter.\n\nLet's think about how to store the data. Maybe a list of tuples, where each tuple is (A_i, B_i). Or perhaps two separate lists, A and B, each of length N.\n\nBut for comparison, maybe it's easier to process each pair.\n\nLet me think of how to structure this.\n\nSample Input 1 might look like:\n\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, N is 4, and the next four lines are the pairs.\n\nI think the approach would be:\n\n- Read N from input.\n- Then read N lines, each split into two integers, A and B.\n- Initialize count to 0.\n- For each i from 0 to N-1 (since zero-based, but days are 1-based? Wait, in the problem statement, i ranges from 1 to N, but in code, it's easier to loop from 0 to N-1, and for each, compare B_i and A_i.\n\nWait, no, the loop can be straightforward.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, is that correct? Because each line corresponds to day i, and we're checking each day.\n\nLet me test with the sample.\n\nTake Test Case 1:\n\nInput is 4, followed by 4 lines:\n\n2 8 \u2192 B > A, yes \u2192 count 1\n\n5 5 \u2192 5 is not >5 \u2192 no.\n\n5 4 \u2192 4 <5 \u2192 no.\n\n6 7 \u21927>6 \u2192 yes. So total 2. So output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nHmm, but wait, what if the input has more than two numbers per line? Oh, the problem says each line is A_i and B_i, so each line has two numbers.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me write it.\n\nWait, but what if the user inputs in a different way, like the second sample?\n\nTest case 2:\n\n5\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\nSo, all B_i are equal to A_i, so count is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample: \n\n6\n1 6 \u2192 6>1 \u2192 count 1\n2 5 \u21925>2 \u2192 count 2\n3 4 \u21924>3 \u2192 count 3\n4 3 \u21923<4 \u2192 no\n5 2 \u21922<5 \u2192 no\n6 1 \u21921<6 \u2192 no\nSo total 3.\n\nSo code should handle that.\n\nSo the code is as simple as reading n, then looping n times, reading a and b, check, and count.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all into code.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nI think that's it.\n\nTesting it with the samples:\n\nTest case 1, output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, I think this should be the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal set for that day.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: First, we read the number of days, \\( N \\).\n2. **Data Storage**: For each day, we read the goal tasks \\( A_i \\) and the actual completed tasks \\( B_i \\).\n3. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the actual completed tasks \\( B_i \\) with the goal \\( A_i \\). If \\( B_i \\) is greater than \\( A_i \\), we count that day.\n4. **Count and Output**: Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of days where \\( B_i > A_i \\) and print this count as the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input gives the number of days \\( N \\).

So, I'll need to read that.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. Read N from the input.\n2. Then, read N lines, each containing A_i and B_i.\n3. For each of these lines, compare B_i and A_i.\n4. Count how many times B_i > A_i.\n\nThen, output that count.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code.\n\nI'll start by reading N. Then, I can have a loop from 0 to N-1, because the input is N lines.\n\nSo, something like:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nLooking at the first test case:\n\nInput:\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, for each day:\n\nDay 1: 8>2 \u2192 yes\nDay 2: 5=5 \u2192 no\nDay 3:4<5 \u2192 no\nDay4:7>6 \u2192 yes. So total 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code should correctly compute this.\n\nWhat about edge cases? Like N=1, and A=1, B=2. Then it's 1.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nI'll start by reading N.\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nLet me see the sample outputs. The first test case outputs 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: the second one has 5 days, all A_i and B_i are 1. So B is not greater than A, so count is 0.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nI think this is the right approach. So the final code is as above.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his daily goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of days, \\( N \\), and the tasks completed each day along with the corresponding goal for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the number of tasks completed (\\( B_i \\)) with the goal (\\( A_i \\)). Count how many times the completed tasks exceed the goal.\n3. **Output the Result**: Print the count of days where the number of tasks completed exceeds the goal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input gives the number of days \\( N \\). Each subsequent line provides the goal (\\( A_i \\)) and the tasks completed (\\( B_i \\)) for each day.\n2. **Counting Days**: For each day, check if the tasks completed (\\( B_i \\)) are greater than the goal (\\( A_i \\)). If true, increment the count.\n3. **Output**: Print the total count of days where the tasks completed exceeded the goal.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each day's data in a loop and counts the required days, ensuring the solution is both clear and effective.",

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of days where Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. So, given N days, for each day i, we have A_i as the goal and B_i as what he actually did. We need to count how many days B_i > A_i.\n\nHmm, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The input starts with an integer N, which is the number of days. Then, there are N lines each containing two integers, A_i and B_i. So, I should read N, then read N pairs.\n\nOnce I have all the B_i and A_i, I can loop through each day and compare B_i and A_i. For each day where B_i > A_i, I increment a counter.\n\nThen, I output this counter.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n2. Read the next N lines, each containing A_i and B_i. Maybe I can store them as a list of tuples or a list of lists.\n3. Initialize a counter to 0.\n4. Loop through each of the N days:\n   - For day i, get A_i and B_i.\n   - If B_i > A_i, increment counter.\n5. After checking all days, print the counter.\n\nLet me think about how to read the input. The input format is a bit specific. The first line is N. Then, the next N lines are A_i and B_i.\n\nSo, in Python, I can read the first line as N = int(input()). Then, for the next N lines, I can read each line, split into two integers, and store them.\n\nLike, something like:\n\nn = int(input())\ndays = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    days.append( (a, b) )\n\nThen, we can iterate through each day in days.\n\ncount = 0\nfor a, b in days:\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\n\nThen, print(count).\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nLooking at the first test case:\n\nInput:\n4\n2 8\n5 5\n5 4\n6 7\n\nSo, days are (2,8), (5,5), (5,4), (6,7).\n\nCompare each:\n\n8>2: yes \u2192 count 1\n5=5: no\n4<5: no\n7>6: yes \u2192 count 2.\n\nSo, output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nI think the plan is solid.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen, read the next n lines, each as a pair.\n\ndays = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    days.append( (a, b) )\n\nThen, initialize count.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor a, b in days:\n    if b > a:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but looking at the sample, in the second test case, all B_i are 1 and A_i is 1. So, none are greater. So, the output is 0.\n\nYes, that should be correct.\n\nSo, the code should be as such.\n\nLet me write it.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if b > a:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n\nI think that's it.\n\nLet me test with the third sample:\n\nInput is 6 lines. Let's see.\n\nThe input is:\n\n6\n1 6\n2 5\n3 4\n4 3\n5 2\n6 1\n\nSo, for each day:\n\n6>1 \u2192 yes.\n\n5>2 \u2192 yes.\n\n4>3 \u2192 yes.\n\n3>4 \u2192 no.\n\n2>5 \u2192 no.\n\n1>6 \u2192 no.\n\nCount is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think this is the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days on which Takahashi completed more tasks than his goal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: We start by reading the number of days, `N`, and then read the number of tasks completed each day along with the corresponding goal for each day.\n2. **Comparison**: For each day, compare the actual tasks completed (B_i) with the goal (A_i).

I need to find out how many days he completed more tasks than his goal.\n\nHmm, so for each day from 1 to N, I compare B_i and A_i.
